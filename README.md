MyAlerts: Alerts System for MyBB
==========================

**Important:** _MyAlerts is still in **BETA**. It is NOT meant for use on live forums until we exit the beta stage. Currently MyAlerts is available to everyone to test for and report bugs, contribute to the code, and see what the features are and how they're implimented._

Current Version: Beta 1
Dependencies:  Plugin Library
Creator: Euantor

General:
-----------
MyAlerts is a plugin for MyBB created and maintained by Euantor. It is a system that provides visual alerts for events in a forum on a user-by-user basis. 

Events:
----------
The currently suppoerted events are:

-When you're quoted in a post
-When somebody replies to a thread you started
-When somebody adds you to their buddylist
-When somebody PMs you

More events are currently in development or planned to be added in the near future. If you have suggestions for events to be added to the core, post them in an issue here on GitHub.

Extensibility:
----------------
MyAlerts is extensible. This means that any external MyBB plugin can create alerts and add them to a user's feed. API documentation will be available as soon as someone gets around to writing it. When there are a few plugins that support MyAlerts, a directory (GitHub wiki page) will be created so users can find compatable plugins.

Contributing, questions, and more:
----------------------------------------------
If you'd like to contribute to MyAlerts, feel free to submit pull requests for features you feel would improve the plugin. If you have an idea or find a bug, we'd love if you'd create an issue so we can all discuss it. It'd also be great if you helped document MyAlerts on the GitHub Wiki by writing about the uses of certian features, creating lists of useful information, or expanding on other's writings.
